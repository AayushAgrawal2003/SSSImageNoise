# SSSImageNoise


## Types of Noise Added:

- Gaussian 
- Speckle Noise 
Speckle noise is majorly found in the images from SSS 
It is also called a multiplicative noise and it is a major problem in some radar
applications. Like Gaussian noise, speckle can be modeled by random values
multiplied by pixel values, I (1+ N). So,
I' = I + IN = I(1 + N) 
Where N is sampled from a Normal Distribution, Mean = 0 and SD = 0.04
